This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library and selecting an image from the user's photo library. After selecting the image, the app crashes with a `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'response.data.uri')` error. This is because the `response.data.uri` property is undefined when using older versions of the Expo SDK and ImagePicker library. This problem arises when the selected image's format or metadata is not handled correctly by the library, resulting in an improper URI being returned.
